This application helps power and utility teams understand historical electricity demand and forecast future trends — using AI-generated scenario explanations.

Here’s what it does step-by-step:

1. Upload Historical Data
The user uploads a file containing past energy demand — like daily or hourly electricity usage.

2. View Aggregated Trends
The app shows summaries, trends, and patterns from the historical data. It helps spot peaks, seasonal shifts, and unusual consumption behaviour.

3. Generate Prompt
The user can generate a natural language “prompt” that describes the uploaded data. This prompt is used to communicate with the AI model in the next step.

4. Generate Scenario Narrative
Using the generated prompt, the app asks the AI to produce a plain English narrative — e.g., “Demand spiked in July due to heatwaves” or “Weekends consistently show lower usage.”

5. Generate Forecast with GenAI Summary
The app creates a demand forecast for future days using built-in logic. Then, AI is applied to each forecast row to generate a smart summary — for example:
  “2024-07-15: Demand expected to rise due to holiday and high temperature.”

The forecast with summaries is saved as a file called `forecast_with_genai_summary.csv`.

6. Visualize Output
The app shows charts and dashboards to help users clearly see:
- Historical usage
- Forecasted demand
- Scenario-based summaries

Who uses this app?
- Power distribution teams
- Grid planners
- Energy analysts
- Utilities needing narrative reports or scenario forecasts

In short, it combines data analysis with AI-generated storytelling — so teams can not only predict demand, but also understand the “why” behind it.
